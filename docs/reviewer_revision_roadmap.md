# KBS second-revision roadmap

This file is the current high-level status record for the four KBS
second-revision reviewer concerns. It supersedes older job-by-job notes that
were tied to transient tmux sessions and mid-run states.

Detailed artifact classification lives in
[`reviewer/kbs_second_revision_artifact_map.md`](reviewer/kbs_second_revision_artifact_map.md).
Evidence-usage rules live in
[`reviewer/kbs_evidence_eligibility.md`](reviewer/kbs_evidence_eligibility.md).

## Status labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `COMPLETE_VALIDATED` | Planned artifact set exists and required audits/gates pass. |
| `PARTIAL` | Some valid evidence exists, but the planned campaign is incomplete. |
| `SMOKE_ONLY` | Useful implementation/profiling evidence exists, but not controlled final evidence. |
| `PENDING_CONTROLLED_RUN` | Protocol exists; final timing or eval still needs a controlled run. |
| `CONTAMINATED_DO_NOT_USE` | Artifact exists for documentation or provenance only; not valid for the target comparison. |
| `HISTORICAL` | Kept for provenance or older manuscript tooling; not the default current path. |
| `BLOCKED_PENDING_SYNC` | Source or artifacts exist elsewhere but are not yet synced into the canonical worktree. |

## Current concern status

### Concern 1: learned-baseline comparison

Status: `PARTIAL`

- Complete and reviewer-usable under the primary controlled window:
  LRB, 3L-Cache, HALP, CACHEUS, plus the non-learned baselines already in
  `analysis/reviewer_fairness/`.
- Still incomplete:
  the eligible held-out `evict_value_v1` comparison rows from the frozen
  cross-family retraining protocol.
- Explicitly ineligible:
  `analysis/reviewer_fairness/policy_comparison_evict_value_v1.csv`.

### Concern 2: supervision-objective ablation

Status: `COMPLETE_VALIDATED`

- 28/28 models complete.
- 84/84 held-out rows complete.
- Same-example audit: `PASS`.
- Fairness audit: `PASS`.
- Registry gate: frozen.

### Concern 3: distribution-shift diagnosis

Status: `PARTIAL`

- The canonical worktree preserves a valid local checkpoint with `24/42` rows.
- The local evidence already shows strong trajectory divergence, but not a full
  seven-family conclusion.
- Wulver family-run orchestration files remain unsynced into this branch, so
  the cluster-side continuation is currently `BLOCKED_PENDING_SYNC` from the
  repository's point of view.

### Concern 4: practical significance

Status: `SMOKE_ONLY`

- Exact-decision-preserving optimization evidence exists.
- Smoke-scale speedups and break-even calculations exist.
- Controlled final timing remains `PENDING_CONTROLLED_RUN`.

## What changed relative to older roadmap entries

Older versions of this roadmap tracked active tmux jobs, in-flight partial row
counts, and provisional next steps during live experiment execution. Those
details were useful operationally, but they are now historical. The current
source of truth is:

- repository state:
  [`kbs_second_revision_repository_state.md`](kbs_second_revision_repository_state.md)
- artifact status and caveats:
  [`reviewer/kbs_second_revision_artifact_map.md`](reviewer/kbs_second_revision_artifact_map.md)
- evidence eligibility:
  [`reviewer/kbs_evidence_eligibility.md`](reviewer/kbs_evidence_eligibility.md)
- internal scientific interpretation:
  [`reviewer/kbs_negative_results_interpretation.md`](reviewer/kbs_negative_results_interpretation.md)
